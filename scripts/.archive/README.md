# Script Graveyard

This is where scritps go when they have outlived their usefulness.
This could be because the task is no longer needed or actionable. 
Or it could be that the script was only intended for one-time use.
If you think some was archived incorrectly, file an issue and I'll
take another look.

## Headstones

### move_site_excl_to_global.rb
